* Master Emacs in One Year
** English version
Guide on how to master Emacs in one year.

The critical question is whether one year is enough.

My answer is a big YES, if you know how to do it efficiently!

Here are the tips *for your first year*:
- Set the standard to the highest
- DON'T create your own setup
- Report bugs to the master
- DON'T learn Lisp
- DON'T remember key bindings
